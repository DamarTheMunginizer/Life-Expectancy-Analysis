## Overview

### Problem Statement

As part of the National Center for Health Statistics team, we have been tasked with providing insight to the correlation between the life expectancy and population. 

The problem is understanding how life expectany disparities such as econonmics, healthcare access, population, etc; influeces life expectancy.

A great place to start is to look at the average life expectancy amoung large populations versus smaller populations. As well as, the average captia per household. 


### Background

Life expectancy can be impacted by various contributors such as economics, access to healthcare, environment, and possibly more. By diving into the varibles at hand and understanding 

the correlation between the population and life expectancy. This project projection is to give insight on whether pouplation plays a big role in life expectancy. 


### Overview of Results

This analysis examined the relationship between the population size and life expectancy across various countries from the year 1800 to 2100. The objective is to show visual support using trends and correlations that highlight how population dynamics may influence the age you can expect to live to.

## Executive Summary

The project was to dive into the factors influencing life expectancy across various regions; with the main focus being populations direct impact. Through data munging, the research 

identified the predictors of life expectancy, such as population. The insights obtained could support data driven decision-making if you only looked at the population size alone for 

demographic regions.


#### Purpose
The purpose of behind the project is to analyze the life expectancy data to:

- Identify if the population alone was a key factor associated with life expectancy.

- I set out to find if the population size was a strong enough to impact the life expectancy alone.

- The numbers related to population as it effects life expectancy is important as it provides recommendations for policymakers to address life expectancy disparities effectively if we begin to factor in other things such as economics, healthcare and etc.

  
#### Methods

The analysis used in this project consisted of some staticial and data visualization to explore relations between the life expectancy and population factors which included:

- Dat Munging: Handling null values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Identifying trends, correlations and skewedness

Removed the null values, outliers and the inconsistent data so my work could be replicated and any addtional things could be added to it.
I eliminated outliers becasue if a location had a very low population count and a disese happened then the number would drop drastically.

  
#### Findings
- Upon deep research and data cleaning I found that population size alone may not effect the life expectancy in any major way; therfore more research will need to be done in order to get enough data to make that statement. Though the chart provide a little support it is not enough to make a confident statement.

  
#### Next Steps

Further research should include:

- Factoring in the other elements such as the health care availability, income, and air quality in the demographic areas.
  
- Incorporating these factors through a machine learning technique seeing the linear regression when factoring the additional elements.
